# tictactoe

I'll be creating a tic tac toe game with 2 players using my usual technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

For now, each player will have a separate term and will work as any normal game of tic tac toe would.

If I can, I'll make AIs of varying difficulty, the ultimate goal being one that is unbeatable (minimax algorithm).

That isn't a promise, but I'll try my best at it!
